# OilSpill_vStruct

## Introduction

> This software was made by the Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction Group of the Center of Atmospheric Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.

> In this repository an oil spill particle dispersion model implemented in matlab, is described. The model is based on a Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm with a second- or forth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. It may use ocean currents from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and winds from the Weather Research and (WRF).

> The model may consider several oil components with a particular exponential degradation rate and a specific relative abundance. The model may also consider other types of decay such as evaporation, biodegradation, burning, and gathering.
