# OilSpill_vStruct

## Introduction

> This software was developed by Julio Antonio Lara-Hernández, Dr. Jorge Zavala-Hidalgo, and collegues within the Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction Group of the Center of Atmospheric Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico. The free use of this software is allowed as long as the corresponding credit is given to the developers.

> In this repository an oil spill particle dispersion model implemented in matlab, is described. The model is based on a Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm with a second- or forth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. It may use ocean currents from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and winds from the Weather Research and (WRF).

> The model may consider several oil components with a particular exponential degradation rate and a specific relative abundance. The model may also consider other types of decay such as evaporation, biodegradation, burning, and gathering.
